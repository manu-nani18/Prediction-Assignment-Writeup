Introduction
The project predicts how well exercises are performed using sensor data.
The goal is to classify classe using other features from accelerometers.
Data Preprocessing
Removed near-zero variance predictors.
Removed columns with too many missing values.
Split data into training, validation, and testing sets.
Model Training
Random Forest achieved high accuracy with 5-fold cross-validation.
GBM also performed well but was slightly less accurate than Random Forest.
Model Evaluation
Random Forest: Accuracy ~0.99
GBM: Accuracy ~0.96
Stacking further improved performance to ~0.995.
Conclusion
The stacking model provided the best performance.
Final predictions submitted based on the stacking model.
